# Real-time Scoring & Leaderboard System

This project implements a real-time scoring system using React and Firebase.

## Key Files
- `src/firebaseConfig.js` - Firebase initialization (UPDATE THIS FIRST!)
- `src/hooks/useGameState.js` - Real-time data listener
- `src/components/ScoreDisplay.jsx` - Shows score during gameplay
- `src/components/LeaderboardForm.jsx` - Form for submitting to leaderboard
- `database.rules.json` - Realtime Database security rules
- `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules

## Important Notes
- Frontend can only READ from Realtime Database (cannot write)
- Score updates must come from Firebase Console or Backend
- Leaderboard entries cannot be modified after submission
